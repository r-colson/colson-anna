      <p>
        My name is Robert Colson. I am a resident of Atlanta, Georgia and live
        here with my family, but planning to relocate to South Carolina soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I work at HubSpot as a Senior Customer Support Specialist.
        Before I worked at a startup company, Coyote Logistics, and other
        smaller companies. I am currently studying to learn Frontend Development
        via Frontend Master's Web Development course.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some interesting accomplishments about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I completed undergrad abroad in Spain, so I never walked a stage to
          graduate.
        </li>
        <li>
          I became fluent in Spanish between 2005-2015.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped build a startup company's Spanish Customer Success Department
          from 1 to 5 employees.
